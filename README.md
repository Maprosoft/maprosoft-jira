# Running

Install Atlassian's Plugin SDK as per the instructions on their website:

https://developer.atlassian.com/docs

Here are the main SDK commands you'll use to contribute to this add-on:

* atlas-compile -- builds the project
* atlas-run     -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug   -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli     -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                   - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help    -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
